### Notes
# `serie`: git-commit graph. could be useful
# `posting`: good candidate for http client adoption
# `resterm`: for inspiration/reference since it uses a text-based request builder
# `harlequin`: decent sql-client, not sure how to navigate it but worth trying
# `phantom`: support git-worktres and tmux but windows, panes based, not sessions
